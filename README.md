# C++ Console Snake

A console version of the classic arcade game Snake, written entirely in C++ as a simple exercise. This is compilable on Windows, and hopefully Linux and MacOS systems (ðŸ¤ž). It also utilises cursor repositioning to avoid clearing the screen, removing blinking when tested on Windows, providing a pretty decent experience.
